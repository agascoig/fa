This repository contains the Coursera Data Science/Swiftkey Capstone
project for Alex Gascoigne (agascoig@yahoo.com).  The project involves
predicting the next word from previous words in a sentence.  The approach
used here is based on a feature attractor network.

date: April 12th, 2016

dataset - partition the dataset into training set and training test set

deploy - shiny application

lexicon - generate dictionary from dataset

lms - adaptively weight the sparse probability matrices

trainer - estimate word probabilities and create sparse matrices
